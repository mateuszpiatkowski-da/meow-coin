# Token Standard

This directory contains `dar` files generated using `daml` from the [Splice Token Standard](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice/tree/main/token-standard) DAML libraries. The yaml files can be found in `@openapi` (see [tsconfig.json](../tsconfig.json))

## Generation

The DAML code in this directory was automatically generated based on the token standard definitions. To regenerate these files, simply type `bun daml:rebuild`.
